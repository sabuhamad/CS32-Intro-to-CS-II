# CS32-Intro-to-CS-II

UCLA CS 32 Introduction to Computer Science 2

Object-oriented software development. Abstract data type definition and use. Overloading, inheritance, polymorphism. Object-oriented view of data structures: stacks, queues, lists. Algorithm analysis. Trees, graphs, and associated algorithms. Searching and sorting.

Course Objective:

> In this course, you will learn how to employ data abstraction to build programs larger than those you constructed in CS 31. You will learn how to use a variety of data structures in the course of solving problems, and importantly, how to analyze what data structures and algorithms are most appropriate for a given problem. In addition, you will deepen your understanding of modern programming by learning the principles of object-oriented and generic programming.
